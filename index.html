          Carnivore was an internet monitoring system released by the FBI on July 11, 2000. Its main purpose and design was to be exclusively used to carry our court-ordered surveillance of electronic communications. In fact, according to Dunham, Griffin S in "Carnivore, the FBI's e-mail surveillance system: devouring criminals, not privacy.", the Carnivore “is a tangible, portable device, tantamount to a phone tap, that allows the FBI to intercept and collect criminal suspects' email without their knowledge or consent.“ (Dunham 1). However, the Carnivore was effectively abandoned by the FBI in mid-January 2005.

            Metadata Collection
          </p>
        <p class="second-paragraph">
One other way of surveillance is by collecting metadata. According to Laura K. Donohue’s "Bulk metadata collection: statutory and constitutional considerations,” by analyzing metadata “the Government can determine whether known or suspected terrorist operatives have been in contact with other persons who may be engaged in terrorist activities, including persons and activities within the United States.” The government is able to sift through all of this data and cherry pick the ones that they want to analyze to detect any terrorist activities are going on. The intelligence agency that does this is the National Security Agency (NSA). The NSA collects vast sums of information:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The NSA collects phone call metadata, including the numbers of both parties, location, time, and duration. 
</li>
          <li>The NSA collects text messages, email chat, and Internet browsing history
</li>
          <li>Smartphone app data, including Google Maps, which can pinpoint a person's location to within a few yards.</li>
          <li>The NSA collects maps of people's social networks, bank and credit card transactions. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="head">
            Metadata Collection
          </p>
        <p>
          Another surveillance system that has been used is wiretapping. In 1994, the Communications Assistance to Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) was passed to regulate telephone and broadband companies and ensure the capability for the government to wiretap phone calls, especially abroad. However, in 2004, the government wanted to expand CALEA because of growing threats on the Internet. The amendment would require companies - such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Research in Motion - to make sure that their services are wire-tappable. The main problem is that it is harder for the government to wiretap if the companies are not complying with the owners. However, more and more companies have been a bit more compliant as time has passed. This is partly due to the FBI recently developing “a ‘Going Dark Program’ to improve its ability to perform electronic surveillance, particularly in light of what it says are difficulties in obtaining wiretap capabilities efficiently from some companies.“
